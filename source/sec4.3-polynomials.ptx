    <title>Multiplicity of Roots and Factors</title>
    <p>
      When a polynomial has a factor <m>x-a</m> associated with a root <m>x=a</m>, 
      the number of times the factor appears is called the <term>multiplicity</term>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, <m>p(x) = 2(x+3)(x+1)^2(x-2)^3(x-4)</m>:
      <sidebyside widths="45% 45%">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><m>x=-3</m> is a root with multiplicity 1</p>

          <li>
            <p><m>x=-1</m> is a root with multiplicity 2</p>

    <title>Shape of Multiplicity</title>
    <p>
      <em>Locally</em> (if you zoom in), the behavior of a graph near a root behaves like <m>x^m</m>
      where <m>m</m> is the multiplicity of the root.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><m>m=1</m>: Graph locally looks like a line passing through axis</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>m=2</m>: Graph locally looks like a parabola touching axis</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><m>m=3</m>: Graph locally looks like a cubic passing through axis</p>

        <li>
          <p><m>m=4,6,8,\ldots</m>: Higher even roots look like very flat parabola</p>

    <title>Roots and Multiplicity to Formula</title>
    
    <p>
      Knowing the roots and their multiplicity allows us to write down the <em>factored</em> representation of a polynomial <em>except</em> for the leading coefficient:
      <md>
        p(x) = A(x-a_1)^{m_1} (x-a_2)^{m_2} \cdots (x-a_k)^{m_k}
      </md>

    <title>End Behavior from Leading Term</title>
    
    <p>
      Limits of a polynomial as <m>x \to \pm \infty</m> behave like just the leading term.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The sign of the leading coefficient always matches the sign as <m>x \to +\infty</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For even degree, limits are the same for <m>x \to \pm \infty</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For odd degree, limits for <m>x \to -\infty</m> is the opposite of the limit for <m>x \to +\infty</m>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <title>Irreducible Factors</title>
    
    <p>
      There can be polynomial factors that don't have any roots, always made up from <term>irreducible quadratic</term>, which are polynomials <m>ax^2+bx+c</m> of degree 2 that have <em>complex roots</em>. The discriminant <m>b^2-4ac</m> that appears in the quadratic formula will be negative. These complex roots come in conjugate pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polynomials always have at least one turning point between any two roots. Any extra turning points must come from irreducible quadratic factors.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> can have <em>at most</em> <m>n</m> real roots (counting multiplicity). (Count number of roots; degree must be that value or bigger)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The difference between the number of real roots (counting multiplicity) and the degree must be a multiple of 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A polynomial of degree <m>n</m> can have <em>at most</em> <m>n-1</m> turning points. (Count number of turning points; degree must be at least one bigger)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
