    <title>Domain, Holes, and Vertical Asymptotes</title>
    <p>
      Starting with a rational function <m>f(x) = p(x) / q(x)</m>, completely factor <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then <m>f(x)</m> is <term>continuous</term> everywhere <em>except</em> at the roots of <m>q(x)</m>.
      Suppose <m>x=a</m> is a <term>root</term> of <m>q(x)</m> so that <m>q(a) = 0</m>.
      If <m>p(a)=0</m> also, then cancel as many common factors as possible.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If the simplified polynomials still have a factor <m>(x-a)</m> in the denominator,
            then <m>x=a</m> is a <term>vertical asymptote</term> or the location of a <term>hole</term>, 
            `also called a <term>removable discontinuity</term></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If <m>(x-a)</m> completely canceled out from the denominator,
            then <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>hole</term> at <m>x=a</m> (removable discontinuity).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </slide>
  <slide>
    <title>Shape and Multiplicity</title>
    <p>
      If we cancel all common factors of the numerator and denominator polynomials to get <m>f(x) = \tilde{p}(x) / \tilde{q}(x)</m>
      and these simplified polynomials are factored, then
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The multiplicity of factors of <m>\tilde{p}(x)</m> (numerator) will match 
            the shape of <m>f(x)</m> with the shape of polynomials at roots.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The multiplicity of factors of <m>\tilde{q}(x)</m> (denominator) result in vertical asymptotes
            with <em>opposite</em> infinite limits when the factor has <em>odd</em> multiplicity and
            with the <em>same</em> infinite limits when the factor has <em>even</em> multiplicity.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Describe the discontinuities and roots of <m>\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{(x+2)(x-1)^3(x-3)^2}{3(x+2)^2(x-1)(x-4)^2}</m>.

    <title>Polynomial Division and Horizontal, Slant and Curve Asymptotes</title>
    
    <p>
      For a rational function <m>f(x) = p(x)/q(x)</m> with polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)</m>, compare the degrees of the polynomials.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>If <m>\deg(p) \lt \deg(q)</m> (higher degree in denominator), then <m>f(x)</m> has a horizontal asymptote <m>y=0</m>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If <m>\deg(p) = \deg(q)</m> (same degree), then <m>f(x)</m> has a horizontal asymptote <m>y=A/B</m> given by the ratio of leading coefficients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>\deg(p) \gt \deg(q)</m> (higher degree in numerator), 
            then <m>f(x)</m> has a slant or curve asymptote <m>y=Q(x)</m> 
            given by the quotient when doing polynomial division <m>p(x) \div q(x)</m>.
            If <m>Q(x)</m> is linear (degree 1), it is a slant asymptote.
            Any higher degree is called a curve asymptote.
